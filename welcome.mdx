Hey! I'm Andy, founder of Finta.

I've spent almost a decade leading accounting and finance teams at VC-backed startups. Now I'm building tax and accounting software for founders like you.

I know how frustrating it is to get straight answers about taxes and accounting. Everyone either hedges their advice or gates it behind a sales call.

What you'll find here is honest, practical guidance from someone who's been there. No sales pitch, no gated content, just what I'd tell my best friend who I'd never charge a penny.

I share the 'why' behind each recommendation so you can make informed decisions for your specific situation.
