This guide is a collection of advice and best practices to help startups navigate taxes, accounting, and finances with confidence and make smarter decisions.

  <Accordion title="Why This Guide">
    Startup founders struggle to find clear, honest advice on taxes, accounting, and finances. Most of it is locked behind sales calls or never shared by experienced founders.
    
    I’ve led finance at three VC-backed startups and worked with top bookkeeping firms—none lived up to the price. Founders shouldn’t have to overpay for the basics.
    
    This guide shares everything I’ve learned to help startups stay compliant, avoid costly mistakes, and focus on building their business.

  <Accordion title="For Startups" icon="alien-8bit">
    This guide is for US-based Delaware C-Corp startups that have raised VC funding and are building software or services.

It’s for founders and operators who value their time, want to stay compliant, and aim to increase their startup’s chances of success—without unnecessary distractions.

  <Accordion title="Using This Guide">
This guide covers the simplest ways to keep your startup compliant, maintain clean and accurate accounting, and get insights to make better decisions.

It’s not legal or tax advice, just practical knowledge from experience. If you have questions or suggestions, email Andy ({first}@finta.com)
