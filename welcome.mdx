This guide is a collection of advice and best practices to help founders navigate taxes, accounting, and finances with confidence and make smarter decisions.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Purpose">
    Startup founders struggle to find clear, honest, and personalized advice on taxes, accounting, and finances. Most of it is locked behind sales calls or never shared by experienced founders.

    Before I starting Finta, I built and led accounting and finance teams at three VC-backed startups. When I worked with top bookkeeping firms, none lived up to the expensive prices they charged. Founders shouldn’t have to overpay for the basics.

    This guide shares everything we’ve learned to help startups stay compliant, automate manual tasks, and stay focused on what matters.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who it's for">
    Everything here is specifically written for US-based, Delaware, C-Corp startups, that have raised VC funding and are building software or services.

    It’s for founders and operators who value their time and want to stay focused to increase their startup’s chances of success.

  <Accordion title="FYI">
