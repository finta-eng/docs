### Overview
The Federal R&D tax credit is a government incentive that rewards startups for innovation in the United States.

For money you spend on developing new products or technologies in the U.S., your startup can get back up to $500,000 per year, for up to five years. This is especially valuable for unprofitable startups.

This credit can only be claimed when filing your annual tax return. Have your tax preparer conduct an R&D study and include it with your tax filing.
