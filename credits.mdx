### Overview
The Federal R&D tax credit is a government incentive that rewards startups for innovation in the United States.

For money you spend on developing new products or technologies in the U.S., your startup can get back up to $500,000 per year, for up to five years. This is especially valuable for unprofitable startups.

This credit can only be claimed when filing your annual tax return. Have your tax preparer conduct an R&D study and include it with your tax filing.

      <Step title="Use the credit">
        Once credits are claimed, you have to use it to get money back. There are two ways to use it, you can only choose one method per year.
    
        1. Reduction of income taxes
        For profitable companies owing taxes, the R&D tax credit directly reduces taxes owed when filing. There are no age or revenue limits for this method. 
  
        2. Refund from future payroll taxes
        Only startups ≤5 years old with ≤$5M of revenue qualify for this approach. After claiming the credit, the IRS will mail you a refund check after each quarter based on payroll taxes paid. The refund is limited to up to $500,000 per year.
