### Overview
The Federal R&D tax credit is a government incentive that rewards startups for innovation in the United States.

For money you spend on developing new products or technologies in the U.S., your startup can get back up to $500,000 per year, for up to five years. This is especially valuable for unprofitable startups.

This credit can only be claimed when filing your annual tax return. Have your tax preparer conduct an R&D study and include it with your tax filing.

### R&D Activities
R&D activities are US-based expenses you pay while trying to create something new or make something better.

For startups, this generally means:
- Engineer/Founder wages for coding new software and ideas.
- Designer/Founder wages for designing new features and ideas.
- Product Manager/Founder wages for defining new products and ideas.
- Raw materials for prototypes
- Hosting and server costs

It generally excludes:
- Engineer/Founder wages for bug fixes or support
- Designer/Founder wages for website, brand, or marketing.
- Product Manager/Founder wages for user interviews, hiring, fundraising, etc.

### How it works
There are two ways to get the R&D tax credit:
1. Reduction of income taxes
- While you file your taxes, if the company is profitable and taxes are owed, you can use the R&D tax credit to directly reduce taxes owed, so when you file your taxes, you pay less.

2. Refund from future payroll taxes
(Only startups <5 years old with <$5M of revenue qualify for this approach)
- File taxes and claim the R&D tax credits
- For future payroll taxes you pay, after every quarter, the IRS will mail you a check as a refund, for up to the R&D tax credit amount claimed
