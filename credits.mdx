### Overview
The Federal R&D tax credit is a government incentive that rewards startups for innovation in the United States.

For money you spend on developing new products or technologies in the U.S., your startup can get back up to $500,000 per year, for up to five years. This is especially valuable for unprofitable startups.

This credit can only be claimed when filing your annual tax return. Have your tax preparer conduct an R&D study and include it with your tax filing.


### How does it work?
Getting the credit back as cash in involves two steps:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Claim the credit">
    This must be done when filing federal income taxes. Once claimed, the credit is there to be used for the next 20 years.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the credit">
    Once credits are claimed, you have two ways of using it:
    
    **Reduction of income taxes**
    For profitable companies owing taxes, the R&D tax credit directly reduces taxes owed when filing. 
  
    **Refund from future payroll taxes**
    After claiming the credit, as you continue to run payroll and pay payroll taxes, you payroll provider will submit a claim to the IRS every quarter.
    
    About 10-12 weeks after each quarter, IRS will mail you a refund check like a refund of payroll taxes paid. Refunds will continue until all R&D tax credits are utilized.

    <Tip>Almost all startups get R&D tax credits back using this approach.</Tip>
    <Warning>However, this approach is only allowed for companies ≤5 years old with ≤$5M of revenue in the filing tax year.</Warning>
  </Step>
