#### Overview
The Federal R&D tax credit is an IRS tax incentive that rewards innovation in the US.

To claim it, a tax preparer needs to conduct a R&D study and include the claim with tax filings.

<Tip>Startups can get back up to $500,000 for R&D Expenses spent in their first five years.</Tip>
<br/>

#### Eligibility
If you spent money on qualified R&D expenses in the US, you're eligible for these tax credits.
<br/>

#### R&D Expenses
Eligible expenses must be spent on creating something new or improving an existing product.

And it must be spent in the US - international expenses, like foreign contractors, are ineligible.
<br/>

#### How It Works
<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Determine credit amount">
      For startups, eligible R&D expenses are typically:
      - Gross pay for employees/contractors doing product, engineering, design
      - Raw materials for physical prototypes
      - Hosting and server costs

      <Info>You must reasonably estimate and apply a % of time spent on eligible activities.</Info>
      - Include time on: scoping, designing, and coding prototypes and new features.
      - Exclude time on: bugs, support, user research, marketing, hiring, fundraising, etc.
      <br/>

      Roughly 10% of R&D expenses can be claimed as credits. For example, if you paid an
      US-based Engineer \$100,000 in salaries last year, then you can claim $10,000. 

      To get a more accurate estimate, see sample calculator at the bottom of this page.
      <br/>


  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Claim the credit">
     Your tax preparer will add the R&D tax credit amount to your annual tax return.
     
     If the IRS has no issues, the credit is approved. But this is not money back yet.

     <Tip>Like a store credit with the IRS - it's not cash, but it can be applied to future purchases.</Tip>
     <br/>
  </Step>


  <Step title="Step 3: Get the money">
    There are two approaches. Every year you must pick one.


    **Option A: Reduce income taxes amount**
    
    If profitable, the amount of taxes owed can be reduced from existing credits.

    For example, say you owe \$1,000 in taxes and have \$5,000 of credits, then you can reduce taxes owed to \$0 and still have \$4,000 credits remaining.

    Most startups are unprofitable with no taxes owed. So this approach is **uncommon**.

    <Tip>Like using your existing store credit to reduce what you have to pay the IRS.</Tip>
    <br/>



    **Option B: Get refund for future payroll taxes**

    As you run payroll for salaried employees, you need to pay payroll taxes to the IRS. 
    
    The IRS will issue a refund to you via mailed checks for those payroll taxes every quarter until all credits utilized.

    For example, say you claimed \$5,000 of tax credits from taxes filed in March.
    Then in Q2 (April-June), you paid \$1,000 in payroll taxes.
    Your payroll provider will submit this refund claim to the IRS, and you'll receive a physical check from them in 10–12 weeks.
    This continues every quarter until the full \$5,000 is claimed.

    <Info>PEO payroll providers typically cause the refund process to take much longer
    because they claim all of their customers' refunds under the same PEO legal entity.</Info>


    Most startups are unprofitable with payroll expenses. So this approach is **common**.

    <Tip>Like paying the IRS then asking to get a refund using existing store credits.</Tip>
    
    
    <Warning>Since this approach is a cash refund, it's limited to companies that incorporated within the last 5 years, have ≤\$5M in revenue for the tax year, and ≤\$500K in credits to claim.</Warning>
