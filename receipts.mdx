### Do I actually need to upload receipts for every transaction?

The short answer is no, and you can ignore those receipt reminders.

### IRS compliance

Back in the old days, when money was predominantly transacted through paper bills and checks,
the IRS started a compliance requirement asking businesses to keep receipts of those purchases for anything over $75.
It’s still like this today, even though most startups now operate entirely with digital transactions. In fact,
only 0.0012% of 1.4 million transactions from Finta’s customers involve cash or checks.

The IRS wants businesses to keep these receipts in the case of a tax audit. An audit is just a request for information.
This happens when something looks really off with your tax filings, like reporting $10 million of revenue but somehow paying
no taxes (even if it was legal somehow). During an audit, the IRS is practical. They just want to see backup records showing
your expenses are legitimate. That’s where receipts help.

Even if you get audited and are asked to provide receipts, as long as you can pull up a digital copy when needed, you’re more than fine.

### Receipt reminders

If you constantly get reminders from your credit card provider to upload receipts, you can just turn them off. It serves no real purpose,
especially for startup founders with more important things to do. If you have features that haven’t been shipped or sales pipelines
sitting cold as well as transactions without receipts, which one do you think your investors will ask about?

At Finta, we changed every receipt policy from \$75 to \$1,000. This isn't even for the IRS. We just want better info for
large purchases in case we need it internally later. Like when you're trying to figure out what a $5,000 purchase was for years later.

Receipts have become such a distraction that Brex even launched a feature to generate them for you using AI. If you use Brex, you should just turn this on.

### Compliance is a growing requirement

Early on, your biggest risk isn’t missing a $76 receipt in an IRS audit. It’s running out of energy, time, and money.
Manually tracking receipts doesn’t solve that. It adds to it. Focus on building product and talking to users instead.

As your company grows, so do compliance requirements. Investors, auditors, and regulators will increasingly expect clean
and consistent records. Collecting every receipt over $75 only matters much later, when your company is public and beyond.
That’s when systems matter. But by then, you’ll have a dedicated in-house Controller to handle it.

For now, don’t stress over this distraction. Focus on making something people want.
