<Warning>
“I’m panicking about receipts—do I really need to keep everything?”
</Warning>

The standard advice is to keep receipts for all business purchases over $75. But that can be a time-consuming distraction from your primary focus—making your startup a success.

Building a startup can feel like getting chased by a pack of hungry zombies. Are you going to stop for every red light, or run right through them? Receipts are like stop lights in a horror movie; sometimes founders just need to keep running.

The bottom line? Don’t lose sleep over receipts. And you can even turn off those pesky reminders in Brex.

### IRS Rules

The IRS guideline says that you need to keep receipts for all business expenses over $75 that you want to claim as a deduction on your taxes. They will review these transactions if you are audited.

An audit is simply a request for information, and the IRS is very practical. You’ll be asked to justify big expenses and top purchases, and they will only need to dig deeper if you cannot justify your books. You won’t be penalized for not having receipts.

The good news? Audits for early-stage startups are rare. You’ll likely only be audited if there’s some discrepancy in your tax filings (for example, if they suspect illegal activity or tax evasion).

### What I Would Do

Compliance is a curve. As you grow, you’ll be under more scrutiny. Founders often ask, “So when do I need to start uploading and keeping every receipt?” Luckily, it’s not on you to make this decision. When it’s time to hire a controller or CFO, that person will set internal policies for financial compliance.

So keep running from those zombies. Focus on the most urgent and important tasks on your plate to help your business succeed.
