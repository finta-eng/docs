### Overview
Delaware requires companies that have filing requirements to file an annual report and pay franchise taxes every year.

The annual report simply includes information about the company's cap table and directors.

While franchise taxes are... well sort of made up for "existing in the state" and the amount is just as arbitrary.

Most companies have to file the annual report and pay franchise taxes, which is one combined step.

  <Accordion title="How the tax is calculated">
    It should be based on this simple calculation:

If your cap table changed throughout the year, Delaware will use a weighted-sum based on the number of days of what the cap table structure looks like.

For example, if you incorporated on 7/1/2024, then for the first half the year it's $0. Second half is $400. So that comes out to $200. Then plus $50 filing fee, you should owe $250.
