### Overview
The Delaware franchise tax is a fee that companies pay to Delaware each year to keep their legal status. It’s not a tax on profits — it’s a cost of being incorporated there. The state collects billions in fees from this system every year.

Many startups incorporate in Delaware because VCs require it, as Delaware’s business-friendly laws make it easier for investors to navigate legal issues.

  <Accordion title="Who needs to pay and file?">
    Every company incorporated in Delaware must pay the franchise tax and file an annual report, even if it doesn’t do business there.
    
    Some founders assume they don’t need to pay if they have no revenue, no activity, or operate in another state — but the obligation exists regardless unless they formally dissolve the company.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deadline and late penalties">
    The franchise tax and annual report are due **March 1 every year** and must be completed together.

    If tax amount is ≥ $5,000, payment and filing is required every quarter.
    
    Missing the deadline results in a $200 late fee plus 1.5% interest per month on the unpaid tax.
    
    After a few months of nonpayment, Delaware could classify the company as _"not in good standing"_. After multiple missed payments, the state may shut down the company to make it legally nonexistent.

  <Accordion title="How the tax is calculated">
    It should be based on this simple calculation:

If your cap table changed throughout the year, Delaware will use a weighted-sum based on the number of days of what the cap table structure looks like.

For example, if you incorporated on 7/1/2024, then for the first half the year it's $0. Second half is $400. So that comes out to $200. Then plus $50 filing fee, you should owe $250.
