### Overview
Delaware requires companies that have filing requirements to file an annual report and pay franchise taxes every year.

The annual report simply includes information about the company's cap table and directors.

While franchise taxes are... well sort of made up for "existing in the state" and the amount is just as arbitrary.

Most companies have to file the annual report and pay franchise taxes, which is one combined step.

### Requirement
If you incorporated in Delaware, then you have to file this. Even if your company has no revenue, no transactions, or isn't even active - you still have to file it as long as you haven't legally and formally shut down the company yet.

### Deadline
March 1 of every year.

If your company has >$XXX of assets, then you're required to file quarterly.

### Late penalty
Daily interest at a monthly rate of 1.5% for taxes owed, up to something. Plus a random penalty.

### Instructions
A lot of steps, but not that hard.
Key thing to remember is to click "Recalculate"
You'll enter a lot of addresses...

### Tax amount
It should be based on this simple calculation:

If your cap table changed throughout the year, Delaware will use a weighted-sum based on the number of days of what the cap table structure looks like.

For example, if you incorporated on 7/1/2024, then for the first half the year it's $0. Second half is $400. So that comes out to $200. Then plus $50 filing fee, you should owe $250.
